  Joins a voice channel in a guild.

  Lets this process listen for the end of an audio track in a guild.

  This will subscribe this process up until the next time an audio track
  ends, to react to this, you'll want to handle the message in some way, e.g.
  ```elixir
  Voice.listen_for_end(guild)
  receive do
    {:audio_stopped, ^guild} -> IO.puts "audio has stopped"
  end
  ```
  This is mainly designed for use in genservers, or other places where you don't
  want to block. If you do want to block and wait immediately, try
  `wait_for_end/2` instead.

  ```elixir
  def handle_info({:audio_stopped, guild}, state) do
    IO.puts "audio has stopped in \#{guild}"

  ```elixir
